#LLM #LlaMA

LLaMA, a collection of foundation [[What is a large language model (LLM)|large language models]] ranging from 7B to 65B parameters.

Comparisons in following tasks:
- Common Sense Reasoning
- Closed-book Question Answering
- Reading Comprehension
- Mathematical reasoning
- Code generation
- Massive Multitask Language Understanding
In summary, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while being more than 10Ã—smaller, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B
