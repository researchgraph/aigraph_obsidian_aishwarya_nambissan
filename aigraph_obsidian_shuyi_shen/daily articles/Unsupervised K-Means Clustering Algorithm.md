#K-Means #clustring #improvement 

Problem:
Although it is an unsupervised learning to clustering in pattern recognition and machine learning, the k-means algorithm and its extensions are always influenced by initializations with a necessary number of clusters a priori. That is, the k-means algorithm is not exactly an unsupervised clustering method.

Solution:
The paper have constructed an unsupervised learning pattern for the k-means algorithm, which allows it to be initialized without parameter selection and can also find the optimal number of clusters simultaneously.
