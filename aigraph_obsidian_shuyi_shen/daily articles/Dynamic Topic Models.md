What is dynamic topic models?
Dynamic topic models are a type of probabilistic model used to analyze collections of documents that change over time. They are an extension of traditional topic models, which are designed to identify the underlying themes or topics in a collection of documents. Dynamic topic models take into account the fact that topics can evolve and change over time, and allow for the modeling of topic transitions and trends. They are based on state space models, which are commonly used in time series analysis, and use variational inference techniques to estimate the model parameters.

Why?
Many collections of documents change over time, and traditional topic models are not able to capture these changes. For example, news articles, social media posts, and scientific publications all reflect current events and trends that can evolve rapidly over time. By modeling the evolution of topics over time, dynamic topic models can provide insights into how these events and trends are reflected in the language used in the documents. They can also be used to identify important topics and trends that emerge over time, and to track the evolution of these topics over multiple time periods. In addition, dynamic topic models can be used to make predictions about future topics and trends, based on the patterns observed in the historical data.
