[Density-Based Clustering: DBSCAN vs. HDBSCAN | by Thomas A Dorfer | Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/density-based-clustering-dbscan-vs-hdbscan-39e02af990c7)

#clustring #HDBSCAN

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- Density-Based - arbitraryÂ shape clusters
- Noise - low density areas.

HDBSCAN
- [[Understanding the concept of Hierarchical clustering Technique|Hierarchical]]
- A modified representation of distance between points

Comparison

|  | DBSCAN | HDBSCAN |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Parameters | two | only one, intuitive|
| Noise | susceptible | prudent |
| Speed | | faster |
