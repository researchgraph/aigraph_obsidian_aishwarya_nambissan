# Text Clustering Algorithms: A Review

1. Summary of the paper:
	The article provides a comprehensive review of various traditional text clustering algorithms, their algorithm theory, and a comparison of their features. Generally, these algorithms cover four kinds of clustering algorithm: hierarchical clustering, distance-based partitioned clustering, density-based clustering and organizing maps algorithm. The paper provides detailed and clear tables to illustrate the comparisons, but it does not give the quantitative analysis, in other words, no specific statistic.
	
2. Clustering algorithm used:
	- Hierarchical clustering
		- Bottom-up hierarchical clustering (Agglomerative)
		- Top-down hierarchical clustering (Divisive)
	- Distance based partitioned clustering
		- k-means
		- K-mediod
	- Density Based Clustering
		- DBSCAN
		- DENCLUE
	- Organizing Maps Algorithm
		- Self-organizing map
3. Comparison of different clustering algorithm:
	The article makes a very detailed comparison and provides nice tables![[6e7613594bf43617c98dd712d5c7f5e.png]]
