# A comprehensive survey of clustering algorithms: State-of-the-art machine learning applications, taxonomy, challenges, and future research prospects

1. Summary of the paper:
	This paper is a comprehensive survey of clustering algorithms, covering topics such as taxonomy of clustering algorithms, the latest study on clustering methods (before 2021), 9 properties of evaluating the performance, 14 cluster similarity measures and 54 validation measures, open issues, and finally various applications. The most valuable part of this article is the taxonomy. Overall, all clustering algorithms are divided into two categories, namely, **Hierarchical clustering algorithm** and **Partitional clustering algorithm**, and both categories has several subdivisions. For each category and subcategory, the paper gives detailed explanation of concept and theory. Although the paper doesn't make comparisons between different categories of algorithms, it is a worthwhile resource for practitioners and researchers to have a preliminary understanding of different type of clustering algorithms.
