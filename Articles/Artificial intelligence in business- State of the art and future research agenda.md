**Aim** : 
1. To study the evolution of research on AI in business over time, highlighting seminal works in the field, and the leading publication venues.
2. Clustering the publications into topics.
3. To understand the main developmental trends and the resulting challenges, including robots and automated systems, Internet-of-Things and AI integration, law, and ethics, among others. 
4. To propose an agenda that guides the directions of future AI research in business addressing the identified trends and challenges.

Insights:

- The literature on AI in business-related categories started in 1977.
- _Futures_ is the journal that gathers the greatest number of papers discussing the implications of AI in business categories
- Number of articles related to AI published between
	- 1970-1979 - 1
	- 1980-1989 - 43
	- 1990-1999 - 70
	- 2000- 2009 - 70
	- 2010- 2019 - 220
- Most AI research is impacting Governance, Manufacturing, Society as a whole and Finance.


-  Reference network or citation analysis was conducted to identify works that strongly influenced AI in business.
- There is a very scattered network of paper citations. Despite a large number of citations, not many seminal references were cited in most papers.
- Top citations were sorted by in-degree scores. The highest in-degree score is a book from Russel and Norvig(1995).


-  Topic analysis was conducted on the paper abstracts to uncover latent discussions in the identified literature using [[Latent Dirichlet Allocation]].
- 18 topics were discovered which could be categorized into four main clusters: societal impact of AI, organizational impact of AI, AI systems, and AI methodologies.
