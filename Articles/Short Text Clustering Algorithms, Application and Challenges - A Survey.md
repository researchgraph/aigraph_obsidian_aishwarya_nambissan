### Applications of Short Text Clustering
- Information retrieval (IR): Clustering methods have been used in various applications in information retrieval, including clustering big datasets. In search engines, text clustering plays a critical role in improving document retrieval performance by grouping and indexing related documents.
- Internet of Things (IoT): With the rapid advancement of technology, several domains have focused on IoT. Data collection in the IoT involves using a global positioning system, radio frequency identification technology, sensors and various other IoT devices. Clustering techniques are used for distributed clustering, which is essential for wireless sensor networks.
- Biology: When clustering genes and samples in gene expression, the gene expression data characteristics become meaningful. They can be classified into clusters based on their expression patterns.
- Industry: Businesses collect large volumes of information about current and prospective customers. For further analysis, customers can be divided into small groups.
- Climate: Recognising global climate patterns necessitates detecting patterns in the oceans and atmosphere. Data clustering seeks to identify atmospheric pressure patterns that significantly impact the climate.
- Medicine: Cluster analysis is used to differentiate among disease subcategories. It can also detect disease patterns in the temporal or spatial distribution.

### Challenges of Short Text Clustering
- Lack of information: A short text has only a few words, leading to a lack of information and poor document representation. Each short text does not include sufficient information on word co-occurrence, and most texts are likely created for only one topic.
- Sparsity: The length of a short text is limited. This short text can represent a wide range of topics, and each user uses unique word choice and writing style. A given topic has a wide range of content, so determining its features is difficult.
- High dimensionality: Representing the short text using standard text representation methods, such as TF-IDF vectors or BOW, leads to high-dimensional features that are less distinct for measuring distance. In addition, the computational time required is extensive.
- Informal writing and misspelling: Short text is used in many applications, such as comments on microblogs, which contain noise and many misspellings, and the presence of a particular language style. In other words, users of social media platforms such as Twitter tend to use informal, straightforward and simple words to share their opinions and ideas. Furthermore, the online questions and search queries do not use the grammar seen in official documents.
