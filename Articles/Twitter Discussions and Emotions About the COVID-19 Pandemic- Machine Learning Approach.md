**Background**: COVID-19–related tweets published between March 7 and April 21, 2020 were collected.
A list of COVID-19–related hashtags were used as search terms to fetch tweets (eg, #coronavirus, #2019nCoV, #COVID19, #coronaoutbreak, and #quarantine)

From March 7 to April 21, 2020, 35,204,604 tweets were collected. After removing non-English tweets, 23,817,948 tweets remained. After removing duplicates and retweets 4,196,020 tweets remained in the final data set.

**Features for each tweet**: (1) the full text, (2) the numbers of favorites, followers, and followings, (3) users’ geolocation, and (4) users' description/self-created profile.

**Preprocessing**:

Removing hash tag symbol and urls from each tweet

Removing non-English characters

Removing special characters, punctuations and stop words.
