# Obsidian Vault

Hi all! Welcome to this Obsidian Vault, a meticulously curated repository dedicated to the expansive domains of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT, and the multifaceted universe of clustering algorithms. This vault serves as an enlightening beacon for newcomers in the field, providing insight and clarity into complex topics. As new interns, this vault also records our learning process during this semester to expand our knowledge on clustering. Enjoy!

### Folder Structure
The vault has the following folder structure:

**Articles**: This folder is used for storing summaries of articles or blog posts read.

**Articles - 2**: This folder also contains more summaries of articles or blog posts read.

**Clustering Algorithms Comparison**: This folder is used for storing the analysis after studying  papers that compare different clustering techniques

**Performance-comparison**: This folder is used for storing the findings after comparing the performances of different clustering algorithms and topic modelling techniques implemented by us.

**Pre-Processing**: This folder is used for storing the findings after comparing different pre-processing techniques.
