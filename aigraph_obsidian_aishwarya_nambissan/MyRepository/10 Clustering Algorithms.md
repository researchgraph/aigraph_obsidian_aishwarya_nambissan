1. Affinity Propagation - finds a set of examples to summarize the data in the best way
2.  BIRCH - Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using  Hierarchies involves constructing a tree structure from which cluster centroids are extracted
3. DBSCAN - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise refers to the process of identifying regions with a high concentration of data points within a given domain. These regions are then expanded to include nearby points, resulting in the formation of clusters in the feature space.
4. [[K-means clustering]] - Assigns examples into a cluster to ensure that similar examples are grouped together.
5. Mini-Batch K-Means - Modified version of k-means that makes updates to the cluster centroids using mini-batches of samples rather than the entire dataset, which can make it faster for large datasets, and perhaps more robust to statistical noise.
6. Mean Shift -  Involves finding and adapting centroids based on the density of examples in the feature space.
7. OPTICS -  Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure augments the ordering of a dataset based on its density-based clustering structure instead of directly producing distinct clusters. This augmented ordering contains information that is comparable to the density-based clusters obtained using various parameter settings.
8. Spectral Clustering - Uses the top eigenvectors of a matrix derived from the distance between points. It is a general class of clustering methods drawn from linear algebra
9. Gaussian Mixture Model -  Summarizes a multivariate probability density function with a mixture of Gaussian probability distributions
10. Agglomerative Clustering - Involves merging examples until the desired number of clusters is achieved
