Perplexity is a commonly used measurement in
information theory to evaluate how well a statistical
model describes a dataset, with lower perplexity denoting a better probabilistic model. But, in some cases, it is unstable and shows varying results with the selected seeds for the same data set.

So a new approach in which the rate of perplexity change (RPC) is calculated, and the change point of RPC is determined to be the most appropriate number of topic was proposed. 

Datasets used : 
- Whole genome sequences of 119 Salmonella enterica strains
- The dataset which includes 996 drugs with 4500 side effects filtered by MedDRA from SIDER2 database
-  Abstracts of 885 papers published in the IEEE Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB) from the PubMed database.

Result:

The novel method was found to be unique, accurate, easy to use, and applicable to the different datasets with different data types, and therefore, improving the accuracy and efficacy of topic model-based text mining and data mining.
