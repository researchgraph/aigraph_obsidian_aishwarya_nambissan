[[Topic Modelling |Topic models]] are prominent for demonstrating discrete data and give a productive approach to find hidden structures in gigantic information. 

LDA is used as an intuitive approach for calculation of similarity between the source files and obtain the respective distributions of each document over other topics.

It supposes that any part of the text is combined by selecting words from probable baskets of words where each basket corresponds to a topic. The tool goes via this process over and over again until it stays on the most probable distribution of words into baskets which are called topics. LDA can provide a useful view of a large collection in terms of the collection as a whole, the individual documents, and the relationships between the documents.
